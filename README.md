# Optimisation of cutting problem

## 2D cutting problem
Calculate the minimum amount of standard size sheets required to make the required amount of different shapes from it.
After calculating it, the CAD drawing to produce that many shapes from standard sheet is generated and can be viewed in the notebook. Only we need to input the dxf file created in laser cutting machine to make the shapes.

## 1D cutting problem
Calculate the minimum amount of standard profiles required to make the required amount of different lengths from it.
